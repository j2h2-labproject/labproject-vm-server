Handlers are modules that manage certain requests from the front-end server. The main handler will match a request operation to a handler that exposes that it has that operation. 

Handlers must have two functions:

handle (operation, params, callback) - When the handler is selected, the operation and paramaters are passed via this function

callback has parameters 'error' and 'data'. If an error occurs in the handler, the error parameter should have a string describing the error, otherwise it should be null. The data parameter should be set to any data returned, True if the handler was successful, but returns no data, and null if an error occurs.

handles (operation) - Returns bool - Indicates if the handler has the operation 


vm_handler - Manages local virtual machines via Libvirt
disk_handler - Manages hard disk images via Libvirt
status_handler - Returns server information and status
iso_handler - Manages local ISO files
switch_handler - Manages local Open vSwitch switches
network_handler - Manages any other networking operations
